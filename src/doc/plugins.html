  In order to modularize WikiNoi and simplify installation of third-party code, WikiNoi is built with _plugins_ at its core. 
  Every plugin is a wiki, potentially with sub-wikis inside of it when plugins are sufficiently complex.

  ## Instantiatable plugins

  A plugin is said to be Instantiatable if it has a `template` element inside:

  ```html
  &lt;noi-wiki id="plugin-name" plugin&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/template&gt;
  &lt;/noi-wiki&gt;
  ```

  The motivation behind this is to bring valid markup into the document without interpreting
  it until the plugin is activated with [[noi-instantiate|noi/core/noi-instantiate]].

  Plugin's template may also contain sub-wikis (defined in their entirety or by reference ^[1]^) that `noi-instantiate`
  will recursively instantiate.
  
  ^[1]^: `&lt;noi-wiki src="#..."&gt;&lt;/noi-wiki&gt;`

  ## Non-instantiable plugins

  Plugins that don't use `template` enveloping are interpreted by the browser immediately,
  leaving user with no choice. This is typically used for the core plugin and other plugins
  that should be mandatory.
