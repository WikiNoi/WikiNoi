This is a very important operation for a wiki that is edited locally.
While it's imperfect (saving a file over and over is not very
practical), it's the the first way to get the updated information saved.

Solution: add `document.noi.getHTMLBlob()` function to construct export HTML

Also, expose it through the navbar in Bulma renderer
