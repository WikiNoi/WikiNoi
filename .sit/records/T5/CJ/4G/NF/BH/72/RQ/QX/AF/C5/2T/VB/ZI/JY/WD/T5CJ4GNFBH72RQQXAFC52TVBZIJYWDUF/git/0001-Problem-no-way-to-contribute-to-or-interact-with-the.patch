+**This project does not accept GitHub Pull Requests**. This is done intentionally,
+as it allows us to maintain the entire history of submitted patches using [SIT](https://sit.fyi).
+
+Any opened Pull Requests will be closed. The contributors will be asked to use our
+own merge request procedure (see below).
+
+Our goal is to encourage frictionless contributions to the project. In order to
+achieve that, we use Unprotocols' [C4 process](https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4)
+as an inspiration. Please read it, it will answer a lot of questions. Our goal is to
+merge patches as quickly as possible and make new stable releases regularly.
+
+In a nutshell, this means:
+
+* We merge patches rapidly (try!)
+* We are open to diverse ideas
+* We prefer code now over consensus later
+
+It is highly recommended to watch [Pieter Hintjens' talk on building open
+source communities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzxcILudFWM) as well as
+read his [book on the same
+matter](https://www.gitbook.com/book/hintjens/social-architecture/details).
+
+# Submitting an issue
+
+According to C4's [development process](https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4#24-development-process),
+the issue should describe a documented and provable. What this means is that an
+issue should strive to have a clear, understandable problem statement. Just like
+a patch, it SHOULD be titled "Problem: ..." and have a detailed description
+describing evidence behind it, be it a bug or a feature request, or a longer
+term "exploratory" issue.
+
+Unlike C4, we're not using GitHub (or any other well-known platform) for issues.
+Instead, we're using SIT itself. Please refer to [README](https://github.com/sit-it/sit#open-an-issue)
+section that covers this process.
+
+# Preparing a patch
+
+According to [patch requirements](https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4#23-patch-requirements),
+the patch should be a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one identified and
+agreed problem. A patch commit message must consist of a single short (less
+than 50 characters) line stating the problem ("Problem: ...") being solved,
+followed by a blank line and then the proposed solution ("Solution: ...").
+
+```
+Problem: short problem statement
+
+Optional longer explanation of the problem that this patch
+addresses, giving necessary details for the reader to be
+able to understand it better.
+
+Solution: explanation of the solution to the problem. Could
+be longer than one line.
+```
+
+# Preparing a merge request
+
+Once you have a branch (BRANCH) with your patch ready:
+
+Run `sit mr <BRANCH>` and either use the suggested text as is or edit it.
+Please keep in mind that currently it expects the first
+line of your commit to be a one-line problem statement
+(it will copy it to the summary), the second line to be
+empty and the rest to be a description (you can see
+an example right above).
+
+If you would prefer to attach your merge request to an existing issue (for
+example, there's a bug report, or a problem statement already recorded), simply
+extend the above command to this:
+
+```
+sit mr <BRANCH> <ISSUE-ID>
+```
+
+Then, at the end, it will give you a command line to copy-paste to send the
+request out.
