Sometimes it might be necessary to refer to wikis defined elsewhere. The
original motivation for this need was to be able to package plugins
without putting all data inside of one element, but there's definitely a
greater utility to this.

Solution: add `src` attribute to `noi-wiki`

For example,

```html
<noi-wiki src="#default">
</noi-wiki>
```

would refer to a locally hosted `default` wiki.

Although there's no support for remote wikis, this is something of a
particular interest and will probably be implemented down the road.
There are some challenges associated with this, for example, handling
remote wikis having their own links, transclusions, and so on.
