Current rendering mechanism has a minor, but annoying problem -- every
time a wiki is rendered, a FOUC (Flash Of Unstyled Content) happens.
This is because the style is applied only after it's loaded.

Solution: by default, render wikis with `display: none` style
but override it with `!important` inside of the wiki's own view styling.
