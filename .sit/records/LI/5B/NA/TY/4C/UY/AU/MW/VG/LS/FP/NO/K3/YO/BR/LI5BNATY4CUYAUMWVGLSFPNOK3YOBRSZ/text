Solution: use StandardJS (standardjs.com)

As a part of this transition, .noi files are being renamed to .html so
that eslint properly understands them. This has an added benefit of
automatic syntax support for these files (because they are, in fact,
HTMLs).

Also, third-party code has been moved to `vendor` and is not subject to
StandardJS guidelines
